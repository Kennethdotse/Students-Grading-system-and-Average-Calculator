# Students-Grading-system-and-Average-Calculator
This project models a school assesment sysyem.

This is a C console application that is able to take the marks of students in a class, given a user-defined number of students in the class.
It then caculates the mean of all the marks and sorts the marks in ascending order.

it then goes further to calculate the average of a student's marks in various subjects, given the number of credit hours and marks attained in each subject.

it also assignes remarks based on the respective performance in a subject.
